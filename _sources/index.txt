SHA-256 user guide
''''''''''''''''''

There are two interfaces to SHA256 - process based and function based. The
process based interface uses separate thread to perform the hashing. The
function based interface uses the calling thread for the computations. The
former interface is slightly faster. Both interfaces can be sped up further
by judicious use of word vs byte manipulation instructions.

AES user guide
''''''''''''''''''

AES (Rijndael) encryption and decryption is performed using the functions
below. Typically, a key is first expanded using the appropriate function
(depending on whether one decrypts or encrypts) and then the stream is
encoded/decoded using AESEncryptBlock() or AESDecryptBlock(). A convenience
function calls both for single block streams.
The AES interface assumes that all data is word-aligned. Character streams
have to be aligned to fit on word boundaries.
